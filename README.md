# Crypto_Arbitrage

*Module 3 Challenge - Looking for Bitcoin arbitrage opportunities between Bitstamp and Coinbase exchanges in the first quarter of 2018*
The arbitrage opportunities were much better in the early part of the dataset (Jan 27th) than the middle (Feb 24th) or later (Mar 29th)
I used pandas for python for the analysis.
